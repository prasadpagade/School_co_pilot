## Email: 2025-11-19 - December Birthdays!

**From:** "Lobeda, Grace" <grace.lobeda@theacademyk12.org>

**Email ID:** 19a9db9b439c50d0

Hello Kinder Parent,

I am excited your child has a birthday this coming month! I wanted to send
an email to let you know how we celebrate birthdays here in our classroom.
(All of this can also be found on our class website
<https://sites.google.com/theacademyk12.org/ms-lobedas-kindergarten/birthday-celebrations>
.)

On your child's birthday, or as close to it as possible, you have the
option of bringing in a treat, prize, or goody bag for each classmate. It
is not a requirement to bring anything, as students will receive a special
chair, crown, and prize from Ms. Garcia and myself on their birthday, as
well as a fun birthday song/dance.

Treats:  Treats will be eaten in class in the afternoon. Treats need to be
pre-packaged (nothing homemade) and the label must read "made in a nut-free
facility." If they are not, we unfortunately will not be able to open and
partake in them.

   -

   We have 28 students in our class and 2 teachers, so please make sure
   there are enough for each person.
   -

   I also appreciate knowing in advance that a treat or prize at least 5
   days in advance is coming in, so I can plan accordingly.


Goodie Bags:

   -

   We have 28 students in our class, so please make sure there are enough
   for each child.
   -

   Ideas for prizes: stickers, pencils, small squishies, etc.


Birthday Invitations: Occasionally there are students that like to invite
classmates to their birthday parties. If you are going to provide
classmates invitations, please email me to let me know, then send them in
your child's backpack, and I will distribute them in Friday folders.


If you have any additional questions, please let me know! We look forward
to celebrating your child! :)

All the best,

## Email: 2025-11-10 - Book Bags- coming home today!

**From:** "Lobeda, Grace" <grace.lobeda@theacademyk12.org>  
**Date:** 2025-11-10 14:24:09  
**Email ID:** 19a6fa80fccd06bd

Hello parents,

You are receiving this email because you opted-in for your student to
participate in Book Bags.

*Today is the day! Your child is bringing home their Book Bag!*

Inside this bag will be either a Letter List, Word List, or a book (depending
on their reading level/ability).   The goal is for your child to practice
the list or book with you.  Once they are fluent in the task, you will fill
out a Raffle Ticket, and put everything back in the bag returning the book and
the raffle ticket.

Your child will then turn their Book Bag in to our yellow bucket and myself
or Ms. Garcia will then test your student. If they are successful, they
will receive a prize.

Once your child has passed that list or book, they will then also get a new
list or book sent home, ready to read again with you!

*(Please keep track of these bags, they will be collected at the end of the
year from each child.)*

I hope you all enjoy this resource and have a great time instilling the
love of reading in your children!

All the best,
<https://sites.google.com/theacademyk12.org/ms-lobedas-kindergarten?usp=sharing>

Hi wonderful families,

On Monday, November 10th please let your kindergarten scientist bring one
stuffy to school that they can fit in their backpack. Their class has
earned a prize in science specials and chose to bring a stuffy. Today, they
measured the temperature of warm and cold water and were careful while
using their thermometers. They did a wonderful job sharing supplies and
their genius with each other. Their passion for learning and curiosity is
amazing to see. Thank you for all your help and support. Have a great
weekend!

Hello Ananya and Prasad,

I just wanted to double check that you received 2 tshirts like you ordered!
We had another girl (whose hook/backpack is right next to Denali's) that
took home two tshirts but had only ordered one. She brought back this extra
xs and I just thought maybe it was Denali's additional shirt! Let me know
and I'll send it home with her today!

All the best,

Hello kinder parents!

I hope you're having a good week and staying healthy!

This last Friday in Friday folders, your child was sent home a project
called *Turkeys in Disguise*. It is each student's responsibility to come
with a fun disguise for their turkey so Farmer Brown doesn't prepare them
for Thanksgiving supper!

If you're looking for a fun idea, Pinterest has a ton of cute options!

Hello Parents!

This is Mrs. Gibbons, the music teacher. I am writing to let you know that
Ms. Lobeda's class is just the second class to reach 26 points in music
class! This is a great accomplishment, especially considering that they did
not have music class the first two days of school (These were half days, so
no specials for kinder)!
The class voted and we will be having game time during the second half of
music class tomorrow.
Be sure to congratulate your child!
Warmly,
Cheryl Gibbons

PS Mark your calendars! Our kindergarten concert is coming up on Thursday,
December 4th! It will be at 6 pm at the Main Campus. You do not want to
miss it!

## Email: 2025-10-29 - Invitation to Contribute to The Academy's Strategic Planning - Round 2

**From:** The Academy of Charter Schools <academy.eblasts@theacademyk12.org>  
**Date:** 2025-10-29 09:00:33  
**Email ID:** 19a30b52643e0bcb

Dear Wildcat Families,Thank you to everyone who responded to our strategic planning survey during conference week earlier this month. Your input was very helpful! I'm writing today to share a summary of what that input included and invite you to a follow up round of in-person conversation to hear more about your perspectives.That in-person community conversation will happen at the Main Campus on Tuesday, November 18th at 5:30pm. We'd love to have as many people join us as possible. If you can make it, please RSVP using this form to give us an idea of how many people we should be prepared to host. The event will be geared toward adults but kids are certainly welcome.Summary of Community Input - Round 1The survey responses we received in early October identified five clear trends around what families value and what they would like to see emphasized in the future. Those trends include:Strong Academics: As a school of choice, it is important for The Academy to provide a stronger, more rigorous academic experience than the standard neighborhood option. This is a key part of our mission to ensure students are ready for college and career.Enrichment Opportunities & Advanced Coursework: A key aspect of providing a strong academic experience includes well-developed programming for students identified as gifted, challenging enrichment opportunities for all kids performing above grade-level, and a variety of options for earning college credit through Concurrent Enrollment and Advanced Placement courses.Well-Rounded Student Experience: Academics matter a lot, but our families also want their students to have access to a variety of well-rounded, high quality experiences. These include athletics, the arts, outdoor education, clubs and activities, and more.Safety: Promoting a safe school environment should always be a top priority.Communication & Family Engagement: Families value regular, clear, and transparent communication. They enjoy participating in community events and want meaningful opportunities to volunteer and be involved in their student's life at school.Plan for Community Input - Round 2On November 18th, we will spend time digging deeper into the five topics listed above through community conversations. We will start by setting the scene as a whole group and then break into five smaller groups to facilitate more intimate discussions. Every group will rotate through 10-12 minute conversations on each topic, facilitated by a member of The Academy's Admin Team. We want to hear more about what each topic means to you so we can ensure that your voice is included in our future planning.I hope to see you on November 18th. Thank you in advance for contributing to our school's future success!

## Email: 2025-10-28 - Book Bag Participation

**From:** "Lobeda, Grace" <grace.lobeda@theacademyk12.org>

Hello parents,

Starting in November, I will offer another way to encourage reading at
home.  Reading with your child is the most important activity you can do to
help your child grow in his/her reading. Research shows students that read
20 minutes a day (average of 1,800,000 words a year) score in the
90th percentile, and a student that reads 5 minutes each day (average of
282,000 words a year) score in the 50th percentile.

If you would like your child to participate in Book Bags, please fill out
this Book Bag Participation
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvNWjU-wfnICQYv9nqEHJ3bXGsIo5R2G84OMC_cRpBCWbY2w/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=117704986115976218188>
link. Your child will not receive a Book Bag unless you fill out this form.

Here's the lowdown on how the Book Bags work:

Your child will be given a "Book Bag".

[image: IMG_8734.jpg]

Inside this bag will be either a Letter List, Word List, or a book
(depending on their reading level/ability).   The goal is for your child to
practice the list or book with you.  Once they are fluent in the task, you
will fill out a Raffle Ticket, and put everything back in the bag returning
the book and the raffle ticket. Your child will then turn their Book Bag in
to our yellow bucket and myself or Ms. Garcia will then test your student.

[image: IMG_8732.jpg].

If they are successful, they will spin a wheel to win a prize.

Once your child has passed that list or book, they will then also get a new
list or book sent home, ready to read again with you!

Attached are detailed instructions and ideas of what to do before, during,
and after reading with your child. *(Please keep track of these bags, they
will be collected at the end of the year from each child.)*


I hope you all enjoy this resource and have a great time instilling the
love of reading in your children!

All the best,

We are gearing up for our Trunk or Treat on Thursday, October 30; we hope
you're planning to join us!  In the past the Bingo team has donated $10,000
each year to purchase the candy for Trunk or Treat. With Bingo no longer
running, we're looking for your help. Last year we had approximately 1000
guests who came through to get candy at each trunk. We anticipate at least
this many again this year.  Would you help us out? Just send a bag of candy
(individually wrapped) to school with your student to give to his/her
teacher. It's that easy. We'll have this event up on the R.O.A.R. hub soon
so you can track your donation as volunteer time. Look for those details
next week.

Elementary K-5 Art is participating in a creative fundraiser with Art to
Remember that allows you to purchase keepsake products customized with your
child's art. A flyer is coming home today; check it out for more
information!

I hope you have an amazing weekend! 🍂🍁

**From:** The Academy <academy.eblasts@theacademyk12.org>

**Email ID:** 19a17532d0a1acfa

It’s hard to believe that October is almost over. Fall is in full swing, and we have many exciting events and celebrations to share with you. Thank you for your continued support in helping make our school community such a wonderful place for students to learn and grow.__________SNAP BenefitsDue to the federal government shutdown, SNAP benefits for November may be delayed. School meals are still available. If you need additional food before your SNAP benefits are available, there are local resources that can help:Colorado 211: Call 2-1-1- or 866-760-6489 or visit www.211colorado.org.Feeding Colorado: Visit www.feedingcolorado.org/find-food or email info@feedingcolorado.org.Hunger Free Colorado Food Resource Hotline: 855-855-4626.__________Trunk or TreatPull out those costumes, dust off that treat bag, and join us for our Trunk or Treat on Thursday, October 30, from 5:30 - 7:30 pm. The cost is $10 per student. You won't want to miss this ghoulishly fun time! Click here for information on ticket pre-sales.__________Trunk or Treat Candy DonationsIn the past, the Bingo team has donated $10,000 each year to purchase the candy for Trunk or Treat. With Bingo no longer running, we're looking for your help. Last year we had approximately 1000 guests who came through to get candy at each trunk. We anticipate at least this many again this year. If each grade level, club, or sport could have families donate enough to have around 2000-2500 pieces of candy, that would be amazing. This allows for two pieces of candy for each participant. Click here to give monetary donation or drop off donations at the main office at either campus.__________Middle School Candy DriveMiddle school will be holding a candy drive to help support this year's trunk or treat.

Hello lovely kinder parents,

This is a friendly reminder that the field trip to Anderson Farms is
tomorrow!

*Classroom Tshirts*
While we hoped our classroom tshirts would arrive in time for our first
field trip, the specialty design is taking a bit longer than expected. For
the field trip to Anderson Farms please have your student wear their green
Academy shirt from the PTO (given out at the beginning of the year) so that
we can all match. We will let you know when classroom t-shirts arrive.

etc.
