# 🤔 Railway vs Render - Which Should You Use?

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Railway | Render |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Free Tier** | $5 credit/month | 750 hours/month |
| **Always On** | ✅ Yes (with credit) | ⚠️ Sleeps after 15min (free) |
| **Auto-Deploy** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **HTTPS** | ✅ Included | ✅ Included |
| **Ease of Use** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Custom Domain** | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| **Best For** | Always-on apps | Development/testing |

## Recommendation

### Use **Render** if:
- ✅ You want the simplest setup
- ✅ App can sleep when not in use (first request takes ~30s)
- ✅ You're okay with occasional cold starts
- ✅ You want the easiest experience

### Use **Railway** if:
- ✅ You need the app always-on (no sleep)
- ✅ You want faster response times
- ✅ You have $5/month credit (or willing to pay)
- ✅ You need more reliability

## My Recommendation for Your Use Case

**Use Render** because:
1. **Simpler setup** - Easier for first-time deployment
2. **Free tier is generous** - 750 hours/month is plenty
3. **Good for sharing** - Family can use it, occasional sleep is fine
4. **Easy to upgrade** - Can switch to paid plan later if needed

**However**, if your ex-wife and step mom will use it frequently and need instant responses, **Railway** might be better.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Render if:**
- First time deploying
- Want simplest experience
- Occasional use is fine

**Choose Railway if:**
- Need always-on
- Want fastest response
- Have $5/month credit

## You Can Use Both!

You can deploy to both and test which works better:
1. Deploy to Render first (easier)
2. Test it for a few days
3. If sleep mode is annoying, deploy to Railway too
4. Share whichever works better

## Next Steps

1. **Try Render first** (see `DEPLOY_RENDER.md`)
2. **Test for a few days**
3. **If sleep mode is an issue**, deploy to Railway (see `DEPLOY_RAILWAY.md`)

Both platforms are great - you can't go wrong with either!
